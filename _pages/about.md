I am a Machine Learning PhD student at the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University advised by professor [Bryan Wilder](https://bryanwilder.github.io). My current work focuses on leveraging  machine learning and optimization to develop AI for equitable, data-driven decision making.  My ultimate goal is to apply my research to real world problems that affect the less fortunate; my true passion is to maximize the positive outcome of my work to society. In a past life I was a Machine learning engineer at [Factored.ai](https://www.factored.ai) working on deep learning. I hold a B.Sc. and a M.Sc., both in Mathematics from Universidad de Los Andes (2017, 2018). My CV can be found [here](assets/pdf/CV.pdf).
