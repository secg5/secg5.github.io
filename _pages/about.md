I am a Machine Learning PhD student in the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University advised by professor [Bryan Wilder](https://bryanwilder.github.io). My main interest is in quantifying uncertainty in models, data and the optimization process surrounding machine learning pipelines involved in data-driven decision making. My ultimate goal is to apply my research to real world problems that affect the less fortunate, my true passion is to maximize the positive outcome of my work to society. My previous gig was as machine learning engineer at [Factored.ai](https://www.factored.ai), a company part of Andrew Ng's AI Fund ecosystem. During my time in the industry, I have developed deep learning applications, specially in computer vision, that overcome common problems (such as data quality and lack of computational power) faced outside the big techs companies. The techniques and specifics of each one of the aforementioned projects can be found in my [CV](assets/pdf/CV.pdf). I hold a B.Sc. and a M.Sc., both in Mathematics from Universidad de Los Andes (2017, 2018).
